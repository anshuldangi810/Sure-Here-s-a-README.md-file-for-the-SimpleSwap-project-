# SimpleSwap - Decentralized Token Swap Platform

## Project Title: SimpleSwap

### Project Description

**SimpleSwap** is a decentralized platform that allows users to swap two different ERC-20 tokens (Token A and Token B) directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform also enables liquidity providers (LPs) to add liquidity to the pool in exchange for a share of the swaps. Users can easily swap tokens, check liquidity status, and view or change the current swap rate.

The project leverages smart contracts and Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, making it decentralized, secure, and transparent. It is a foundational tool for those looking to swap tokens without relying on centralized exchanges.

### Project Vision

The vision behind SimpleSwap is to provide an easy-to-use, decentralized alternative to traditional centralized exchanges for token swaps. By utilizing liquidity pools, users can directly swap their tokens in a decentralized manner, and liquidity providers can earn rewards for their contributions.

We aim to enhance the ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) by simplifying token swaps and offering an intuitive interface for non-technical users. As blockchain technology evolves, we want to build and improve upon this platform to support new use cases and token standards.

### Key Features

- **Token Swapping**: Allows users to swap Token A for Token B at a specified swap rate.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Users can add liquidity to the platform by contributing both Token A and Token B. Liquidity providers help ensure there is enough liquidity for swaps and earn rewards.
- **Swap Rate Management**: The owner of the contract can adjust the token swap rate (e.g., 1 Token A = 2 Token B).
- **Liquidity Status**: Users can check the current liquidity status of the pool.
- **Web3 Integration**: The platform connects to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask and Web3.js, enabling smooth interaction with smart contracts.

### Requirements

1. **MetaMask**: You must have MetaMask installed in your browser to interact with the Ethereum network and the SimpleSwap contract.
2. **Web3.js**: This project uses the Web3.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute smart contract functions.

### Prerequisites

Before using the SimpleSwap contract, ensure the following:

- **Token A and Token B (ERC-20)**: You need two ERC-20 tokens (Token A and Token B) deployed on the Ethereum network. These tokens are used for swapping within the platform.
- **Ethereum Network**: Ensure you have MetaMask connected to an Ethereum-compatible network like the Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, or any other test network.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-swap.git
   cd simple-swap
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

### How to Use

#### 1. **Swapping Tokens**

- Enter the amount of **Token A** you wish to swap in the input field under **Swap Tokens**.
- Click **Swap** to exchange Token A for Token B based on the current swap rate.

#### 2. **Adding Liquidity**

- Enter the amounts of **Token A** and **Token B** that you wish to add to the liquidity pool under **Add Liquidity**.
- Click **Add Liquidity** to transfer the tokens to the contract and increase the liquidity pool.

#### 3. **Viewing Liquidity**

- Click **Get Liquidity** to check the current amounts of Token A and Token B available in the liquidity pool.

#### 4. **Changing Swap Rate (Owner Only)**

- The **Owner** of the contract can set a new swap rate by entering the new rate (e.g., 1 Token A = 2 Token B).
- Click **Set Swap Rate** to update the rate.

### Smart Contract

The SimpleSwap contract is implemented using Solidity and the ERC-20 token standard. Below are some of the key functions within the contract:

- **swapTokens(uint256 amountIn)**: Allows users to swap Token A for Token B based on the current swap rate.
- **addLiquidity(uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB)**: Allows the owner to add liquidity to the pool.
- **getLiquidity()**: Returns the current liquidity of both Token A and Token B.
- **setSwapRate(uint256 newRate)**: Allows the owner to set the swap rate for the token exchange.

### Web3 Integration

The frontend uses Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This is accomplished through the following:

- **Web3 Provider**: MetaMask acts as the Web3 provider, allowing users to connect their Ethereum accounts and interact with the smart contract.
- **Contract ABI & Address**: The contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) and address are used to interact with the SimpleSwap contract.

### Contract Deployment

Deploy the SimpleSwap contract on the Ethereum network using tools like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Once deployed, update the frontend code (`index.html`) with the deployed contract address and ABI.

### How to Test

1. **Test Token Contracts**: You can deploy ERC-20 test tokens (Token A and Token B) on the test network like Ropsten using Remix or any other Solidity IDE.
2. **Interact with the Contract**: Use MetaMask to connect to the test network, and then interact with the SimpleSwap contract via the frontend.

### Known Issues

- **Token Approval**: Before swapping tokens, users need to approve the SimpleSwap contract to spend their Token A and Token B. Ensure the allowance is set appropriately in MetaMask.
- **Gas Fees**: Every transaction on the Ethereum network requires gas. Ensure that the wallet has enough ETH (for the Ethereum mainnet) or the native token on the test network to pay for gas fees.

### Future Improvements

- **User Interface**: Improve the UI/UX for better user experience and accessibility.
- **Swap Fee**: Add a small fee for token swaps to incentivize liquidity providers further.
- **Token Pair Support**: Support for more token pairs beyond just Token A and Token B.
- **Cross-chain Support**: Enable swaps across different blockchains using wrapped tokens.
